## Introduction

"WSL Quiz" is an interactive quiz that users can take to test their knowledge of the Women's Super League - England's top tier professional women's football league.

The quiz dynamically presents the user with questions, provides visual and auditory feedback for a correct/incorrect answer, tracks what question users are currently on and also tracks the user's score. The user can earn a maximum of 100 points. 

The purpose of the quiz is to test the knowledge of WSL fans. With the women's game growing at a rapid pace after the World Cup 2023, this quiz also serves to increase knowledge for anyone who would like to learn more about the WSL. 

This website was made for the second of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (e-Commerce Applications) program at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/ "Link to Code Institute homepage").
